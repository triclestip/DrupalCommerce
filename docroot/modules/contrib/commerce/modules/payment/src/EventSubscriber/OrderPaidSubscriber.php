   * Places the order after it has been fully paid through an off-site gateway.

   * Off-site payments can only be made at checkout.
   * If the gateway supports notifications, these two scenarios are possible:
   *
   * 1) The onNotify() method is called before the customer returns to the
   *    site. A payment is created, the order is now considered fully paid,
   *    causing the "payment" step to no longer be visible, sending the
   *    customer back to the first checkout step.
   * 2) The customer never returns to the site. The onNotify() method completed
   *    the payment, but the order is still unplaced and stuck in checkout.
   *
   * To avoid both problems, this subscriber ensures that the order is placed,
   * which also ensures that the customer is sent to the checkout complete
   * page once they (eventually) return.
   *
   * @param \Drupal\commerce_order\Event\OrderEvent $event
